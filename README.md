# EasyStorageTracker - Java Generics Project

**EasyStorageTracker** is a Java application that demonstrates the use of
**Generics**, **wildcards**, and **bounded types** to create a flexible, type-safe storage system. 
It models a delivery company's storage solution, efficiently managing items such as books, gadgets,
and perishable goods.

### Key Features:
- **Generic storage units** for storing various item types.
- **Utility methods** to display and check items.
- **Expiration checks** for perishable items.

This project highlights my proficiency in advanced Java concepts while building practical, reusable solutions.
